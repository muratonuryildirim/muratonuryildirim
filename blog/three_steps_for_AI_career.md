# [How to Build a Career in AI](https://info.deeplearning.ai/how-to-build-a-career-in-ai-book)
*Andrew Ng, 2022*

**TL;DR:** Mainly three steps to build a career in AI: learn foundational skills, work on projects and build a portfolio, search for a relevant job.

Andrew starts his words with stating how AI resembles the electricity because it is and will be changing human life, just like electricity did.
This also brings discussion of coding literacy and how it becomes *a new* *language literacy*. In other words, everybody eventually will need to 
understand the language of computers at least at a basic level.

Mainly three steps to build a career in AI: **(i) learning foundational skills, (ii) working on projects, and building a portfolio, (iii) searching for a relevant job.**

## **Learning Foundational Skills.**

First of all, it is important to prioritize topic selection such as what attracts you, what you are interested in on the subject of artificial intelligence. 
Because there are more research papers on AI available than someone could ever read in their lifetime. However, before prioritizing the topic, you need to learn
the following major topics for a technical career in machine learning.

**Foundational machine learning skills:** It is crucial to understand basic concepts such as *linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, 
decision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection*. Actually, having an insight into fundamental ideas behind how machine learning operates, 
including *bias/variance trade-off, cost functions, regularization, optimization algorithms, and error analysis*, is more crucial.

**Deep Learning:** Even though deep learning is a subset of machine learning, it makes up such a big portion of it and most of the work and development
take place in this field. Hence, the fundamentals of neural networks, as well as practical knowledge for implementing them such as *hyperparameter tuning, 
convolutional networks, sequence models, and transformers*, are important.

**Math:** Key topics for machine learning include *linear algebra, probability and statistics and, calculus*. In addition, *exploratory data analysis* (EDA)
can be particularly useful in data-centric development. AI specific math books, tutorials and lectures can help to understand those topics easier and faster.

**Software development:** While the former points help to understand the background of AI and how it works, good software implementation skill is necessary to get
a job. These skills are; programming fundamentals (preferably with Python), data structures, database and data manipulation algorithms, and key libraries such
as *TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn*.

During or after learning those foundational skills, you can prioritize the topic that attracts you such as *natural language processing, computer vision,
signal processing, graphical models, and efficient/scalable systems*. That will help you to stick to one area and learn more about it!

## **Working on projects, and building a portfolio.**

Over the course of a career, you will work on a series of projects, each of which grows in size and complexity. The first few projects might be
*class projects or basic case studies* that are narrowly scoped with predetermined right answers. Those help you to acquire great learning experiences.
After that, you can challenge yourself with personal projects such as reproducing a known algorithm and participating in competitions such as those 
organized by Kaggle. In time, you will be able to create more tangible value. This opens the door to more resources and opportunities. That is why
*don’t worry about starting too small.* 

**Finding a project.**

To find a project and built a portfolio, you can read and talk with people to come up with an idea or you can join an existing projects and more importantly,
you can focus on an application area. Although each direction is exciting, it is not also very easy and feasible to follow every development in AI.
Here is a quick checklist of factors to consider a project that would most likely to be your benefit: 

*Will the project help you grow technically?* It should be challenging enough to push your talents, but not so difficult that you have little possibility of success.
*Do you have good teammates to work with?*  We learn a lot from those around us, and having good collaborators will have a significant influence.
*Can it be a stepping stone?* Its technical complexity and impact should be meaningful for you and the community. 
There is probably a project that might serve as such a stepping stone if it is larger than previous projects you have worked on.
*Ready, Aim, Fire or Ready, Fire, Aim?* Ready, Aim, Fire is designed to make cautious preparations and only when you are really confident, 
then you commit and carry it out. Ready, Fire, Aim, on the other hand, enables to launch your execution immediately, then you can identify issues 
during the journey if required. Unless you are not working on a huge project, taking a shot is inexpensive in AI, so just *Ready, Fire, Aim.*

**Creating your own project.**

*Identify any business problem.* It could be a climate change, material discovery or medical diagnosis; basically anything the world,
*especially you are*, interested in. If you could not find any, ask domain experts: “What are the top three things that you wish worked better?
Why aren’t they working yet?” This is your starting point. Once you find or understand the problem, *brainstorm AI solutions*. This is where you can fly,
come up with *any ideas*, of course relevant to your problem, and list them. *Assess the feasibility and value of your ideas/solutions* by looking at 
published work, asking domain experts and checking what others or competitors have done so far. Then, when you find the best approach, 
*determine milestones*. Create yourself a checklist or to-do/achieve list including both machine learning metrics such as accuracy and business metrics
such as revenue. Finally, *budget the resources*. Think through everything you’ll need to get the project done including data, people and time. 
Note that, AI won't be able to solve every issue, but as a community, let's search for opportunities to improve the world whenever we can. 

## **Searching for a relevant job.**

First, ask those two questions to yourself: *Am I switching roles?* or *Am I switching industries?* If you are a software engineer, university student,
or physicist who’s looking to become a machine learning engineer, that’s a *role switch* and a startup can be an easier place to start since your work is 
more likely to be appreciated. On the other hand, if you work for a healthcare company, financial services company, or a government agency and want to work for 
a software company, that’s a *switch in industries*. Basically, you are switching either roles or industries if you’re looking for your first job in AI.

Most likely, you will not know the necessary requirements for your first job since you are altering your position or sector.  In this situation, informative 
interviewing in which you also ask questions is the best way to go. Informative interviews are very suitable to AI job which is evolving non-stop. You can ask 
the following or similar questions to understand the company and responsibility of the job: 
*What do you do in a typical week or day? What are the most significant responsibilities of this position? What are the most critical skills for success? 
How does your team collaborate to achieve its objectives? How does the recruiting process work? Which factors contributed to the success of previous candidates?*

To sustain your career success in AI, *teamwork and being a team player* is important, so communication skills really matter. 
*Networking* is helpful for knowing more people, having a community and making friends as well. *Personal discipline* is the thing of many successful people 
regardless of the field that they work in. So, develop good habits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal relationships, work, learning, and self-care. 
And, *Altruism;* help others every step of your journey. Because it eventually leads to achieve better outcomes for you and them.

Finally, you will find papers challenging to read and you will make simple mistakes. That is a challenging part of AI, and it’s okay.
‘**If you’ve succeeded at sucking at AI — congratulations, you’re on your way!**’
